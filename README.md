# Md Mahbubur Rahman  

I am simple, nothing special. I love programming, have a tendency to argue with compilers, and With FastAPI + TorchServe, my AI serves predictions faster than a barista serves coffee. I trained models on SageMaker, Vertex AI, and Azure ML—basically, I’m in a polycloud relationship. My pipelines are so smooth, ETL stands for “Extremely Tasty Latte”. I use Kafka so much that even my morning coffee comes with a consumer group.
