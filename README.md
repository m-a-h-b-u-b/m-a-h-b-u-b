## 📝 TL;DR
- Built stuff at **Samsung, Georgia Tech, Acoustic Tech**  
- Won awards (yes, actual shiny ones 🏆)  
- Wrote books 📚  
- Filed 5  US patents 🔬  
- Still debugging life...

## 🛠️ Toolbox
- **Languages I speak with fewer typos:** C/C++, Go, Rust, Python, Node.js  
- **Databases I don’t just SELECT * FROM:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Couchbase, Redis  
- **Buzzwords I actually use in production:** CQRS, Sharding, Caching, Partitioning  
- **DevOps arsenal:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, (coffee optional but recommended ☕)  
- **AI/ML:** Whisper, CNN, NLU, librosa MFCCs (yes, I make computers listen 👂)

## 💼 Work Experience (a.k.a. Places I Broke Things Before Fixing Them)
**Acoustic Technologies** — Senior Software Engineer (2020–Present)  
- Built an AI Semantic Engine (hit 87% accuracy, not bad for machines trying to understand humans).  
- Made things run 60% faster by yelling at the server… and also using JIT + caching.  

**Georgia Tech** — Research Assistant (2018–2020)  
- Created a live audio transcription app (because typing is overrated).  
- Built a wake-word detector that actually wakes up (95% accuracy—better than me at 6AM).  

**Samsung Research** — Lead Software Engineer (2013–2018)  
- Shipped a semantic NLP engine (91% accuracy, almost like reading minds).  
- Built APIs for Smart TVs (yes, those “Are you still watching?” screens).  
- Got awards + a patent for wireless IoT charging ⚡  

**Rise Up Labs** — Software Engineer (2011–2013)  
- Built APIs for games with 75ms latency (faster than my reflexes).  
- Scaled APNs to 30M+ users (because apparently everyone likes push notifications).

## 📚 Books I’ve Written
- *Scaling PostgreSQL to 1B Queries per Day* (because who doesn’t like big numbers?)  
- *Redis at Scale: 10M Queries/Hour* (faster than you can refresh Twitter)  
- *Asynchronous & Concurrency with Python* (a.k.a. Multitasking for Coders)  
- *GitHub Actions for Absolute Beginners* (yes, automation for humans too)  

---

## 🏆 Achievements
- Top 1000 in competitive programming 🌍  
- IEEE Best Paper Award (algorithm design that shaved 13.4% error)  
- Samsung Outstanding Contribution Award  
- Rise Up Labs Best Team Lead Award  
- Survived countless production outages without crying (publicly)  

---

## 🎓 Education
- MSc in Computer Engineering — Georgia Tech  
- Postgrad Diploma in Artificial Intelligence — COS  
- Diploma in MongoDB (yes, they give diplomas for databases now)  

---

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- My code compiles 87% of the time on the first try.  
- I talk to databases more than humans.  
- Patent holder: wireless charging for IoT devices (basically charging stuff without touching it).  
- Favorite debugging tool: rubber duck 🦆.
