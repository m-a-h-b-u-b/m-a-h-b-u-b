## üöÄ About Me  
I‚Äôm a passionate software engineer who builds **high-performance systems**, **AI-driven tools**, and **developer-friendly open-source projects**. Over the last decade, I‚Äôve worked across the full spectrum of modern engineering ‚Äî from **bare-metal bootloaders** to **large-scale AI inference pipelines**.  When I‚Äôm not optimizing code, I write deep-dive articles that transform complex tech into practical, actionable knowledge for developers worldwide.
